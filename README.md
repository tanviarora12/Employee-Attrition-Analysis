# Employee-Attrition-Analysis
Employee attrition analysis and prediction using Python(EDA, ML Models)
📊 Employee Attrition Analysis

📌 Business Problem

Employee attrition (voluntary or involuntary exits) is a major challenge for organizations. High attrition rates lead to increased recruitment costs, knowledge gaps, and lower productivity.
This project analyzes HR data to identify key factors contributing to employee attrition and builds a predictive model to estimate the likelihood of attrition.

🎯 Goal

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on HR dataset.
Identify patterns and factors influencing employee attrition.
Build predictive models to classify employees as “likely to leave” or "liekly to stay".

🛠 Tech Stack
🐍 Python
📈 Pandas, NumPy
📊 Matplotlib, Seaborn
🤖 Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree)
📝 Jupyter Notebook


📊 Process
1. Data Understanding & Cleaning:
-Checked missing values & data types.
-Removed duplicates & outliers.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Attrition distribution by Age, Department, Job Role, Salary, Work-life balance, etc.
-Correlation heatmaps & visualizations.

3. Feature Engineering:
-Encoded categorical variables.
-Scaled numerical features.


4. Model Building:
-Logistic Regression.
-Decision Tree.
-Random Forest.
-Compared performance metrics.

5. Model Evaluation:
-Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
-Confusion Matrix & ROC Curve.

✅ Results & Insights:
-Key factors influencing attrition : Job Role, OverTime, Monthly Income, Job Satisfaction, Years at Company.
-Random Forest model achieved the best performance with ~85% accuracy.
-Employees with high overtime and low job satisfaction are most likely to leave.
